# Introduction #

We still have to write an introduction.

# Meeting Summaries #

In meeting summaries we list what ideas came us in mind and mark a general direction that the development of this software will go in the near future. All meeting summaries are listed in MeetingSummaries.

# Purpose of the project #

We want a software to write notes, annotate PDFs, do whiteboard meetings across the internet and much more. Short said: this software should be a all-in-one-wonder of technology that covers all features that are currently unsupported by others. This is also the reason why we would never call ourselves a clone of Xournal, Microsoft Onenote or other note taking software.
